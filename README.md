# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System

Two repositories are attached in this GitHub project. The goal was to detect the facial features of the driver and to detect its lip contours. Multiple approaches were implemented including Sobel, Canny and Laplacian contour detection. I have also implemented new techniques which include histogram equalization, thresholding and bitwise operations and other complex image processing methods.

The results of one of the algorithms are shown below:

Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions. I will shortly update this repository and provide results for each algorithm I've developed.
